# voiceAtis
Reads an ATIS from IVAO using voice generation.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7 - 32 bit (due to pyuipc incompatibility with Python 3 and 64 bit)
* pyuipc
* pyttsx
* XPlane with XPUIPC or MFS, P3D with FSUIPC
    * Only tested with X-Plane 11
* Windows (Linux and Mac not tested yet)

## Installation
* Get the latest python 2.7 ([Python releases](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Run `pip install voiceAtis`
* Install pyuipc
   * Download [FSUIPC SDK](http://fsuipc.simflight.com/beta/FSUIPC_SDK.zip)
   * Inside this zip-file run `UIPC_SDK_Python.zip\pyuipc-0.3.win32-py2.7.msi`

## Usage
* Start the script "voiceAtis.py"
   * If you would like to see the command output, open it from console. `python voiceAtis.py`
* Start your sim and start a flight.
* Tune the ATIS frequency of the airport where you are parking.
   * Don't forget to activate receive mode of the radio (COM1 or COM2)
* You should hear the ATIS now, if:
   * There is an ATC station online at this airport (TWR, APP, GND or DEL)
   * The airport has an ATIS frequency at [ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com)

### Custom airport data
Airport data is downloaded from [ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com). You can see these data at `airports.info` file at main directory. It may happen that this data is inaccurate or an airport is missing.

In this case you can add the airport to the `airports_add.info` file. Airports in this file have priority over downloaded data.

You may also inform me about wrong data preferably via the Issues tab. I will then enter the data at [ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com) to distritbute them to all users. Alternatively, after login, you may correct the data on your own.

### Notice for X-Plane users
X-Plane has its own ATIS information broadcasted, often on the same (real) frequency. After tuning in the ATIS frequency you will hear the X-Plane ATIS message first and then the message provided by voiceAtis. Because X-Plane also uses the operation system text-to-speech machine like voiceAtis. The voice messages are queued and read after each other.

To avoid the broadcasting of the default ATIS, I created the script `xpRemoveAtisFreq.py`. All ATC frequency are stored in the file `apt.dat`. The script will remove all ATIS frequency from this file. After execution, the default ATIS should be permanently disabled.

Before removal of the frequency, the script will create a backup of the original file as `apt.dat.bak`. If you would like to hear the default ATIS again, simply delete the modified `apt.dat` file and restore the backup file.

Although the script is well tested and there should not occur any side-effects, the use of this script is at your own risk.

## Bugs and issues
* Please report bugs via the github issues tab.
    * It is usefull to attach the logfile from "root/logs".
    
### Known limitations
* METAR
    * No trend
    * No visibility directions
    * No runway condition
* No comments of ivac 2 atis
* X-Plane: Detection of active radio not accurate
* Sometimes airports have more than 1 ATIS frequency (e.g. EDDF or LOWW, for departure and arrival)
    * You might have to try all frequencies to find the one working.

### [ourairports.com](http://ourairports.com)
OurAirports is a free site where visitors can explore the world's airports, read other people's comments, and leave their own. The help pages have information to get you started.

The site is dedicated to both passengers and pilots. You can create a map of the airports you've visited and share that map with friends. You can find the closest airports to you, and discover the ones that you haven't visited yet.

Behind the fun and features, OurAirports exists primarily as a public good. When Australia forced the US government to shut down public access to its Digital Aeronautical Flight Information File (DAFIF) service in 2006, there was no longer a good source of global aviation data. OurAirports started in 2007 primarily to fill that gap: we encourage members to create and maintain data records for airports around the world, and they manage over 40,000 of them. Many web sites, smartphone apps, and other services rely on OurAirport's data, which is all in the Public Domain (no permission required).
